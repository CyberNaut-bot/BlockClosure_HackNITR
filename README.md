# BlockClosure

## Real Estate App on the Blockchain using the power of NFTs

### The problem BlockClosure solves
#### Using the power of Smart Contracts, all transactions in a Real Estate Process can be secured ensuring there is no tampering with the contract. It ensures that the Escrow Account is completely neutral. Land and property registration along with ownership transfer is done through NFTs which guarentees there will be no dispute on the topic. Through NFTs the history of owners can also be found. This helps in Property Management as well as it is easier to collect mortgages and rent through predetermined contracts.

## Functioning of the Dapp

#### User must connect his Metamask Wallet to buy any property. Once connected, user can choose from a list of properties. Ownership of the properties are stored as NFTs using IPFS server. Once listed, the respective NFTs are transferred to the contract's address. The contract acts as an Escrow acoount which holds ownership until certain conditions are met. When the user makes the necessary payment through Metamask, the contract transfers the NFT to the owners address. Thus, ownership of the property has been transferred to the user.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
